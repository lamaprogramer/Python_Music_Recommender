# Description

This is my master project for my AI and Machine learning Level 2 class for Juni Learning. 
This project is designed to recommend similar songs based on input songs.

I implemented two methods of recommending songs, one with an autoencoder, and one with raw librosa audio features.
The autoencoder can be more easily be fine tuned, while the raw librosa features are faster.

# Technologies

- Librosa for audio processing
- OpenCV for image processing
- Tensorflow & Keras for machine learning models
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sklearn for data processing.
  

# Installation
- Clone github repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lamaprogramer/Python_Music_Recommender
```

### Create a virtual environment
I used uv to create a virtual environment, however, you can also use venv.

- Ensure you are using Python 3.10

- Open the downloaded repository in your terminal and create a virtual environment.

#### Virtual environment with UV.
```shell
uv init .
```

#### Virtual environment with Venv.
